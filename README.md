# SimpleUrlShortener - A Django based Url Shortener like goo.gl

This is my first Django project. It's basic and simple. It has the following features:

1. Generation of a 5 letter shortcode for every URL (combination of letters & digits).
2. Statistics for the short urls, just add a trailing slash('/') to the short url.
3. Differentiate between raw hits & unique hits, List all the IPs that accessed the url.

To do:

1. Add GeoLocation support and list top countries that visited the link.

Setup:
1. Setup a virtual environment of python or python3
2. clone the git to it, install django using pip (I've coded this in v2.2.4)
3. Run "python manage.py runserver" when in the src folder.

Alternatively, you can also directly clone the git without a virtual environment.
