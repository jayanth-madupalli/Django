# SimpleUrlShortener - A Django based Url Shortener like goo.gl

This is my first Django project. It's basic and simple. It has the following features:

1. Generation of a 5 letter shortcode for every URL (combination of letters & digits).
2. Statistics for the short urls, just add a trailing slash('/') to the short url.
3. Differentiate between raw hits & unique hits, List all the IPs that accessed the url.

To do:

1. Add GeoLocation support and list top countries that visited the link.
